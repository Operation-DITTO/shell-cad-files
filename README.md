| [shell_model_a.stl](shell_model_a.stl) | Model A was designed after the [3DS Cirlce Pad Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS#Circle_Pad_Pro). It was deemed too uncomfortable and hefty, therefore being redesigned into Model B. |
| [shell_model_b.stl](shell_model_b.stl) | Model B substituted the [3DS Cirlce Pad Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS#Circle_Pad_Pro) design with a unique design that wrapped around the PSP WLAN switch. It is also to note it uses considerably less material to print. |
| [shell_proto_a.stl](shell_proto_a.stl) | Prototype A was an ultimately unused design that featured a detachable slider. It is deemed completely obsolete due to the lack of available space for extra hardware |
